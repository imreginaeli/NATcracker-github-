						<h5 style="text-align: justify"><b>READ INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.</b><br> Before you begin the exam, read all instructions carefully. Read anything that confuses you. </h5>
					</div>
					<div class="wrapdiv">
						<h5 style="text-align: justify"><b>READ EACH QUESTION CAREFULLY. MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION.</b><br> If you feel confused, reread the question. Read the question while covering up the answer choices. Come up with an answer in your mind, and then check to see if it is one of the choices listed.</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="wrapdiv">
						<h5 style="text-align: justify"><b>PLAN YOUR TIME AND READ THROUGH THE ENTIRE TEST.</b><br>This will help you gauge the length of time to spend on each question. Answer first the questions you are most familiar with. This prevents running out of time with "easy" questions still unanswered. Keep track of your time. </h5>
					</div>
					<div class="wrapdiv">
						<h5 style="text-align: justify"><b>DO THE QUESTIONS IN ORDER AND KEEP MOVING.</b><br>Do not skip around. </h5>
					</div>
					<div class="wrapdiv">
						<h5 style="text-align: justify"><b>MARK DIFFICULT QUESTIONS.</b><br>If you are unsure about an answer, mark the one you think is best, place a question mark on the margin, and go on. Later, if you still have time, go back to this question.</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="wrapdiv">
						<h5 style="text-align: justify"><b>USE PROCESS OF ELIMINATION.</b><br>Get rid of as many wrong choices as you can before answering a question. Wrong answers are often easier to find. Look for extremes like "never" "only" or "always". Look for opposites like a substitution of -1 for 1. Look for similarities like, "conjunctive" for "subjunctive." Those could be distractors.</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="wrapdiv">
						<h5 style="text-align: justify"><b>TAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS.</b><br>If you still can not figure out with the right answer the second time you look at the skipped question, at least have a shot to answer the question, and make a guess than no answer at all. DON'T PANIC. Everyone draws a blank on a question or two. So, if you just can't remember an answer, leave it blank and go on. Again, put a question mark on the margin to remind you to go back. The answer will probably pop-up into your mind as you continue. </h5>
					</div>
					<div class="wrapdiv">
						<h5 style="text-align: justify"><b>DON'T CHANGE AN ANSWER.</b><br>Unless you have strong reasons to change it, your first answer is usually right. </h5>
					</div>
					<div class="wrapdiv">
						<h5 style="text-align: justify"><b>USE YOUR TEST BOOKLET OR SCRATCH PAPER.</b><br>It often helps to write as you work, so write down formulas and equations, solve math problems, outline, paraphrase, and underline to help you read. Use the scratch paper to help you.</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="wrapdiv" style="margin-bottom: 75px;">
						<h5 style="text-align: justify"><b>TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.</b><br>During the last few days before the exam, you should ease-up on your review schedule. The natural tendency is to cram. You need to be well rested to do your best. For another thing, cramming tends to raise your anxiety level, and your brain doesn't do its best work when you are anxious. Try some common relaxation techniques—like deep abdominal breathing, tensing then relaxing your muscles, or visualizing a positive outcome on the exam—to combat test anxiety. </h5>
